# Butterfly Species Classifier using Transfer Learning

This project implements an image classification model to classify butterfly species using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes **ResNet50**, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), and applies transfer learning for classifying butterfly images into 40 distinct species.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains images of butterflies categorized into 40 species. You can access the dataset here:

[Kaggle Butterfly Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species)

## Key Features

- **ResNet50 Base Model**: The model uses the **ResNet50** architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, to extract features from butterfly images. The top layers are customized for classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Freezes the pre-trained layers of ResNet50 and adds a custom **Flatten** layer, **Dense** layer (512 units), and a **Dropout** layer to improve generalization.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized before feeding into the model.
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Monitors the training process by visualizing loss, accuracy, and other metrics.
- **Gradio Interface**: Allows users to upload images of butterflies and receive real-time predictions about their species.
- **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset and the performance is saved.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved as `butterfly_resnet50.h5` for later use.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- Seaborn
- Gradio

You can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/butterfly-species-classifier.git
cd butterfly-species-classifier
```

2. **Download the dataset**:

   Download the dataset from [Kaggle Butterfly Species Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/butterfly-images40-species) and place it in the appropriate directory as described in the notebook.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Open the Jupyter notebook `butterfly_species_classifier.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially to train the model.

4. **Launch the Gradio Interface**:

   After training, the Gradio interface is available to upload images and get predictions.

```bash
gr.Interface(fn=predict_butterfly, inputs=gr.Image(type="pil"), outputs="text").launch()
```

## Results

The model achieves good accuracy in classifying butterfly species, with visualized training and validation accuracy/loss plots. You can explore the results in the TensorBoard interface.
