# Butterfly-Species-Classifier-using-Transfer-Learning
This project implements an image classification model to classify butterfly species using deep learning techniques. The model leverages ResNet50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), for feature extraction, and applies transfer learning to adapt it for classifying butterfly images into 40 distinct species.
